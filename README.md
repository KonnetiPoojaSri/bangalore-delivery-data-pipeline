# Food Delivery Analytics Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline for a food delivery system.
It ingests raw CSV data into a Bronze layer database, validates and inspects data,
and prepares it for analytics. The pipeline simulates real-world ETL architecture
used in data engineering projects.
